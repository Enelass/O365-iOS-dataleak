`1- Jailbreak iPhone and setup the SSH server (change default password while you're there...)

2- Bypass Jailbreak detection (Shadow, LibertyLite, Flex) or install old IPA (AppStore++) that did not have jailbreak detection.

3- For OneDrive 12.11.6, use the OneDrive patch on Flex (other tools don't work!)
   Using AppStore++, download an old version of OneDrive if the installed version is not the right one

4- Login using Work Credentials and select "Make Available Offline" on the files to be exfiltrated

5a- For iOS13, 4- Transfer files from iPhone filesystem using SCP
    To find the file, use the following commands...
    Connect to ssh : 		$ ssh root@<iPhone> where <iPhone> is a Bonjour resolved name (e.g. iphone.local) or IP Address (Found in Settings / WiFi)
    Go to top Directory:	$ cd /
    Search for file:		$ find . -name "<File>" where file is "file.zip" or "*.zip" or "whateverthef*"
    Driectory for offline files typically is ./private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/DBD29029-B5D0-4DF5-86C6-ACB767D4DA7D/OneDrive/StreamCacheQt/


5b- Since iOS14, it is slightly harder to exfiltrate data as the data is encrypted at rest.
   For iOS 14, you do "not" need to mmark the file for Offline access:
   A workaround is to click on "Open in another App" and a clear text copy of the files will be placed in cache:
   The new directory includes "tmp" in its address, e.g. ./private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/31C8BB3C-404D-49A2-BDC9-E61C349211CA/tmp/i2k5ymqgmus4yxgt8evtwq/

6- Download the file(s) using SCP
   $ cd ~/Desktop
   $ scp root@<iPhone>:<Path> .
